## Expressions, Variables & Constants Challenges

### Question 1
 Declare a constant `exercises` with value 11 and a variable `exercisesSolved` with value 0. Increment this variable every time you solve an exercise (including this one).
 */
let exercises = 11
var exercisesSolved = 0
exercisesSolved += 1
/*:
### Question 2
 Given the following code:
 ```swift
 age = 16
 print(age)
 age = 30
 print(age)
 ```
  Declare `age` so that it compiles.  Did you use `var` or `let`?
*/
var age: Int  // it is a var not a let
age = 16

/*:
### Question 3
 Consider the following code:

```swift
let a: Int = 46
let b: Int = 10
```
Work out what `answer` equals when you replace the final line of code above with each of these options:
```swift
// 1
let answer1: Int = (a * 100) + b
// 2
let answer2: Int = (a * 100) + (b * 100)
// 3
let answer3: Int = (a * 100) + (b / 10)
```

let answer2: Int = (a * 100) + (b * 100)
let answer3: Int = (a * 100) + (b / 10)

### Question 4
 Add parentheses to the following calculation. The parentheses should show the order in which the operations are performed and should not alter the result of the calculation.
 */
5 * 3 - 4 / 2 * 2
/*:
 Solution:
 */
(5 * 3) - ((4 / 2) * 2)

/*:
### Question 5
 Declare two constants `x` and `y` of type `Double` and assign both a value. Calculate the average of `x` and `y` and store the result in a constant named `average`.
 */
let x: Double = 7.5
let y: Double = 5
let average: Double = (x + y) / 2
exercisesSolved += 1
/*:
 Bonus: why is it important that `x` and `y` are of type `Double`?
 
 Solution:
 If `x` and `y` were of type `Int`, the result would be truncated to an `Int` as well.
*/

/*:
### Question 6
 A temperature expressed in ¬∞C can be converted to ¬∞F by multiplying by 1.8 then incrementing by 32. In this exercise, you will do the reverse: convert a temperature from ¬∞F to ¬∞C.
 
 Declare a constant named `fahrenheit` of type `Double` and assign it a value. Calculate the corresponding temperature in ¬∞C and store the result in a constant named `celcius`.
 */
let fahrenheit = 121.0

/*:
### Question 7
 Suppose the squares on a chessboard are numbered left to right, top to bottom, with 0 being the top-left square and 63 being the bottom-right square. Rows are numbered top to bottom, 0 to 7. Columns are numbered left to right, 0 to 7.
 
 Declare a constant `position` and assign it a value between 0 and 63. Calculate the corresponding row and column numbers and store the results in constants named `row` and `column`.

let column = position % 8

/*:
 ### Question 8
 Declare constants named `dividend` and `divisor` of type `Double` and assign both a value. Calculate the quotient and remainder of an integer division of `dividend` by `divisor` and store the results in constants named `quotient` and `remainder`. Calculate the remainder without using the operator `%`.

/*:
 ### Question 9
 A circle is made up of 2ùúã radians, corresponding with 360 degrees. Declare a constant `degrees` of type `Double` and assign it an initial value. Calculate the corresponding angle in radians and store the result in a constant named `radians`.
 */
let degrees = 360.0
let radians = (degrees / 180) * Double.pi

/*:
### Question 10
 Declare four constants named `x1`, `y1`, `x2` and `y2` of type `Double`. These constants represent the 2-dimensional coordinates of two points. Calculate the distance between these two points and store the result in a constant named `distance`.
 */
let x1 = 1.0

### Question 11
  Increment variable `exercisesSolved` a final time. Use the `print` function to print the percentage of exercises you managed to solve. The printed result should be a number between 0 and 1.
